# Hello World 2 - Meaning behing sketch

I wanted to take a deeper look at what I am trying to create with my sketch. So, I decided to simplify it a bit to explore the reasons for my choices before continuing to add more. I chose a light canvase because I think it sets more of a relaxing tone as opposed to a black background. Secondly, I included a U.S. map that highlights in green where the Navajo Nation is located which can be seen better when you press the mouse because the background will become black. I also included monuments because Monument Valley is not only the most well-known site on the Navajo Nation, the Southwest, but is also home to me. Lastly, when you press a key an image of a translated Navajo prayer that fills the canvas. I included this aspect because I do hope to incoporate language going forward and I thought this would be a good introduction to exploring that more.
